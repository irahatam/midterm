## Cat Spotify

Have you ever hosted a party in the past and have guests wonder what song is currently playing? 

### Never fear, Cat Spotify is here!

With Cat Spotify, you can connect your Spotify account and run the scripts to automatically display currently
playing songs in your TV, with a randomized cat GIF to spice up your party. Just run the script, log in to your
Spotify account and we'll take it from there!


*Disclamer: The COVID-19 Pandemic is currently happening around the world, I wouldn't recommend you throwing
a party right now, but this could be useful for you in the future! #StaySafe and #WearaMask :)*
